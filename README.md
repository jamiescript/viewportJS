# The Problem

Testing responsive web design is generally done by frantically resizing the browser window over and over to see the varying layout changes.

# The Solution

This script will create a block of button elements associated with mobile devices and their orientations. 

Clicking a button will open a new window with the viewport dimensions of that device.
